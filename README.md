Summary
Based on the baseball data, I performed an explanatory analysis on the historical baseball data obtained from the Udacity dataset link. My main research question is: Are height and weight related to baseball performance as measured by batting average (Avg) and home run (HR) career total? Despite not finding any solid evidence supporting this relationship, I found that data visualization can be used for a quick data quality check, identifying players with best (and worst) statistics, and how the two metrics stack up as baseball performance indicator.
